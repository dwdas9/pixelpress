# PixelPress architecture

Author: D Das

## Milestones

Class B1 — the only roadmap this project keeps; a table rewritten in
place, never a growing prose document. Reordered after M2: input
handling and the plan preview moved ahead of the executor, so there
was something interactive sooner. See `CURRENT_STATE.md` for which
one is active right now and what's next inside it.

| # | Milestone | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Scaffold | Done | Solution, `Directory.Build.props`, format registry + capability matrix, presets, Avalonia shell with DI, engine tests. |
| M2 | Planner | Done | Job contracts, path scanning, file classification, nested folders, conflict resolution, plan summary. Pure logic, tested. |
| M3 | Input + plan preview | Done | Drag-and-drop, file/folder pickers, plan preview screen (count, size estimate, output folder, fallback/rename/skip callouts). Optimize button present but disabled — no executor yet. |
| M4 | Executor | Done | Magick.NET adapter, worker pool, atomic writes, metadata preservation, cancellation, per-file results. |
| M5 | Wire executor into plan preview | Done | Optimize button goes live: progress, cancel, completion summary, calm error list. |
| M6 | UI redesign | Done | Design system (palette, typography, cards, button hierarchy), all five states restyled, drag-over feedback. Lossless-only scope reaffirmed; no functional changes. |
| M7 | Premium UI | Done | Light/dark theming (theme dictionaries + `DynamicResource`), header + status bar structure, file table in the plan preview, empty-state copy, micro-transitions. Deferred: live per-file queue statuses (needs engine per-item events), vector logo (packaging milestone). |
| M8 | Settings persistence + advanced panel | Done | Advanced panel in the plan preview: format override, resize to a max dimension (pixel-count cap, never upscales — independent of the lossless preset system, ADR-0005), strip metadata, overwrite originals. All of it plus the preset persists as JSON in the OS app-data folder, loaded at startup, saved at shutdown. Size estimate deliberately ignores resize savings (no pixel work at plan time); the preview captions this. |
| M9 | Packaging | Not started | Self-contained publish for win-x64 / osx-arm64 / osx-x64, icon, final polish. |

## Shape

Single-process desktop app. Two assemblies plus tests:

- **PixelPress.Core** — the engine. Formats, presets, job contracts,
  planner, executor, settings store. No UI references, ever. Magick.NET lives inside
  `Processing/` behind an internal codec interface; no ImageMagick type
  appears in the public API.
- **PixelPress.Desktop** — Avalonia UI, MVVM (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm),
  DI composition root in `Infrastructure/ServiceCollectionExtensions`.
  References Core. Never touches Magick.NET directly.

## Dependency rules

1. Core references no UI assembly.
2. Desktop references Core, not Magick.NET.
3. Core exposes its own format identities (`ImageFormatId`), not
   `MagickFormat`, so the processing library can be swapped without
   breaking the contract.

## Engine design (M2/M3)

Two-phase pipeline:

- **Plan** — scan dropped paths, classify files via `FormatRegistry`,
  resolve output paths and naming conflicts, estimate savings. No pixel
  work. Produces a complete pre-flight plan the UI shows before anything
  runs.
- **Execute** — bounded worker pool (physical core count), one file per
  task. Writes go to a temp file, atomically renamed on success; originals
  are never touched until the replacement is verified. Failures never stop
  the batch; they are collected into the end-of-run summary. Cancellation
  is honored between files.

## Format capabilities

`FormatRegistry` is the single source of truth for decode/encode support.
HEIC, ICO and camera RAW are decode-only. The UI's output picker is
generated from `FormatRegistry.EncodableFormats`, so the UI cannot offer
a conversion the engine cannot perform.

## Memory

Magick.NET Q8 build (half the memory of Q16, imperceptible for consumer
photos). Worker concurrency is capped and ImageMagick resource limits are
set at engine startup so a pathological input degrades gracefully instead
of exhausting RAM.

## M4 notes

- PNG compression-level tuning (per-preset) is deferred — Magick.NET's
  define-based API for it needs on-machine confirmation before relying
  on a guessed signature. Default PNG compression is used for now.
- `MagickImageCodec` and `CodecVerifier.cs` are the only files in the
  engine that could not be compiled in the sandbox this project was
  built in (no network access to nuget.org for the Magick.NET package).
  Everything else — including the executor's orchestration logic — was
  compiled and test-executed against the real source. Run
  `dotnet run --project src/PixelPress.Desktop -- --verify-codecs` on a
  real machine to confirm the codec matrix; see README.
- Animated GIF/WebP sources are decoded via `MagickImageCollection` with
  `Coalesce()`, not `MagickImage` directly — the latter silently reads
  only the first frame of a multi-frame file.

## NuGet security auditing

.NET 8's built-in NuGet Audit checks every restored package against a
known-vulnerability database and reports matches as build warnings
(NU1901-1904). Under `TreatWarningsAsErrors` these become build failures.

Two things keep this from being either a silent risk or a recurring
build-breaker:

- Direct dependencies (Magick.NET in particular, since it bundles many
  third-party delegate libraries such as libpng and libwebp) are kept on
  a current release, since maintainers patch reported vulnerabilities in
  later versions. Bump on `dotnet restore` warnings, not just on a fixed
  schedule.
- `Directory.Build.props` sets `WarningsNotAsErrors` for the audit codes
  specifically (NU1901-1904), per Microsoft's documented guidance for
  projects using `TreatWarningsAsErrors`. This keeps vulnerabilities
  *visible* in build output without letting a newly-discovered issue in
  a transitive dependency silently brick the entire build until patched.
  Genuine code-quality and correctness warnings are still hard errors.
